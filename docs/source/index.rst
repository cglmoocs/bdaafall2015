Homework H4: Get your software set up for later lectures and final project
===============================================================================

First some background: You will need modest software for some of lectures and
homeworks. This can be most easily done in Python but Java is also possible; no
other languages are relevant. You MIGHT use software in final project. Note
the final project will be individual or up to a three person team and can
either be a significant **PAPER** or a **SOFTWARE PROJECT**. We can support
Software in Java on clouds or Python but other software such as R allowed in
final project Your team chooses. You can find sample software and paper
projects. `here <Sample.html>`_.

Java and Python are installed on our cloud as explained in Unit 11. Here you
choose between Python on your laptop, Python in cloud or Java in cloud.  

* DO - Python on your laptop: Download Enthought Canopy Express (free) from
     https://store.enthought.com/downloads/ including NumPy SciPy Matplotlib
* OR - Set up Python in cloud or Java in cloud.  See Unit 11

Tasks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submit results to show your software is set up and running. Solve tasks
following instructions `here <hw4.html>`_ .

.. chapter 1 of  http://openedx.scholargrid.org/c4x/SoIC/INFO590/asset/hw4-bdaafall2015.pdf
