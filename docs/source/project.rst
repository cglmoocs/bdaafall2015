Project Details
===============================================================================

You have a choice to write a term paper or do a software project using our
cloud computing test bed called FutureSystems. However, we encourage you to do
a software project that can be done as a group project. You can form teams of
up to 3 people. Sample project details are given later. You can use the
`BDAA slack project channel
<https://bdaafall2015.slack.com/messages/project/>`_ to form project teams and
also create a private group for your team if you like.
