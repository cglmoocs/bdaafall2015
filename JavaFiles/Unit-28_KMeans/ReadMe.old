5.	Apache Mahout: Is a machine learning library from apache. It has implementations of almost all the popular algorithms  for clustering ,classification etc. . In this course we are going to use this library for K Means clustering .

6.	Apache Mahout KMeans Clustering : org,.apace.mahout.clustering.kmeans.* package has the implementation of the KMeans  and we will be using KMeansDriver class to run the job .Below are the steps involved

i.	Convert our sample dataset into Hadoop Sequential File
ii.	Create initial clusters. Here we have multiple options like using RandomSeedGenerator or with Canopy Clustering
iii.	Call KMeansDriver.run() with the required parameters
iv.	Read the generated output file.
v.	Plotting (optional)
